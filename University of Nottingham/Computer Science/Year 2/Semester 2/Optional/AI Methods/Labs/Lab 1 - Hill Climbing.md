##### Exercises
###### Exercise 1:
![[Pasted image 20230209144123.png]]
- Instance 1
- 5 seconds
- Davis has better performance
###### Exercise 2:
![[Pasted image 20230209144400.png]]
- Instance 1
- (20 seconds)
- Davis still performs better in general, but the Steepest descent has a better worst case 
- Steepest descent is able to get near similar performance to davis due to now having the time to reach it's near-optimal solutions, which it didn't have before.
- It doesn't beat Davis in this case most likely just due to randomness.
###### Exercise 3:
![[Pasted image 20230209144956.png]]
- Instance 9
- 10 seconds
- The steepest descent HC has better general performance than Davis's bit HC, with Davis's bit HC only having a better best case
