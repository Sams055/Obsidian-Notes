### Lecture:
- Preliminaries
	- Definitions
		- Decision Support
			-  Used in decision making contexts
			- Multi-disciplinary
				Can be used for:
					AI
					Operations research
					Decision Theory
					Decision Analysis
					Statistics	
		- Systems
			- Closed systems are independent of their environment
			- Open systems are dependent on their environment
			- System effectiveness refers to the degree of which goals are achieved
			- System efficiency is a measure of the use of resources to achieve output
				- e.g. speed
	- Solving Problems by searching
		- Search for paths to goals
			- efficiently find actions to go from an initial state to a given goal
			- central to AI problems
			- Typical algorithms include
				- Depth First Search (DFS)
				- Breadth First Search (BFS)
				- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
				- Branch and bound
				- A*
		- Search for solutions
			- More general than searching for paths to goals
			- Efficiently finding a solution to a problem in a large space of candidate solutions
			- Subsumes the first type, since a path through a search tree can be encoded as a candidate solution
	- Global Optimisation
		- Task of finding the best set of admissible conditions to achieve your objective, formulated in mathematical terms
		- The fundamental problem of optimisation is to arrive at the best possible decision / solution in any given set of circumstances
		- In most case "the best" (optimal) is unattainable

	- Global and Local Optimum
		- Global Optimum is a solution better than all other solutions (best)
		- Local Optimum is a solution better than all solutions in a certain neighbourhood
