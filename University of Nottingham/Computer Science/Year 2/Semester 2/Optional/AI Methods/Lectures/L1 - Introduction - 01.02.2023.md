### Lecture:
- Preliminaries
	- Definitions
		- Decision Support
			-  Used in decision making contexts
			- Multi-disciplinary
				Can be used for:
					AI
					Operations research
					Decision Theory
					Decision Analysis
					Statistics	
			- We call this when we have an optimisation problem and we need to make a decision if our solution is suitable or not.
		- Systems
			- Closed systems are totally independent of their environment
			- Open systems are dependent on their environment
			- System effectiveness refers to the degree of which goals are achieved
			- System efficiency is a measure of the use of resources to achieve output
				- e.g. speed
			- This is basically a software solution
			- We are going to implement optimisation algorithms and we need to evaluate them.
				- Hence we check the system effectiveness and efficiency

	- Solving Problems by searching
		- Search for paths to goals
			- Efficiently find a set of actions that go from an initial state to a given goal
			- Central to AI problems
			- Typical algorithms include
				- Depth First Search (DFS)
				- Breadth First Search (BFS)
				- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
				- Branch and bound
				- A*
		- Search for solutions
			- More general than searching for paths to goals
			- Efficiently finding a solution to a problem in a large space of candidate solutions
			- Subsumes the first type, since a path through a search tree can be encoded as a candidate solution
			- If you have a problem, you could end up having to search a huge space for the optimal solution
	- Global Optimisation
		- Task of finding the <b> ABSOLUTE BEST </b> set of admissible conditions to achieve your objective, formulated in mathematical terms
		- The fundamental problem of optimisation is to arrive at the best possible decision / solution in any given set of circumstances
		- In most case "the best" (optimal) is unattainable
	- Global and Local Optimum
		- Global Optimum is a solution better than all other solutions (best)
		- Local Optimum is a solution better than all solutions in a certain neighbourhood
		- ![[Pasted image 20230201110145.png]]
		- The graph shows these optimums
			- The neighbourhood of the certain neighbourhood is $$+- \delta $$
	- Solving an optimisation problem
		- ![[Pasted image 20230201110527.png]]
		- Maximise and minimise with respective to a function
		- We define this function
		- We will also have a series of variables where X is a vector of variables <x1, x2, ..., xn>
		- The formula represents our constraints in the system
		- We could take the derivative of a function to find the minimum or maximise, BUT THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO EVERYTHING, hence it's not a solution we should pursue
	- Search in Continuous vs Discrete Space
		- ![[Pasted image 20230201110543.png]]
		- Run the car on 10 tracks and use the 0 - 1.0 as a performance indicator
		- The x1 variable is essentially taking a real value between 0 and 1
		- Say we have x buses waiting for the groups with a set of capacity
		- We have n groups, how are we going to place them into the buses
		- We want to minimise the number of buses x
		- Worst case scenario would be that each group has their own bus
		- ![[Pasted image 20230201110607.png]]
		- The right graph assumes we've generated all possible states
		- The right graph shows multiple solutions
		- We will not be covering continuous optimisation (left graph)

- Heuristic Search / Optimisation
	- Heuristic Search Methods
		-  A heuristic is a rule of thumb method derived from human intuition.
		⚫ A heuristic is a problem dependent search method which seeks good, i.e. near-optimal solutions, at a reasonable cost (e.g. speed) without being able to guarantee optimality. 
		⚫ Good for solving ill-structured problems, or complex well-structured problems (large-scale combinatorial problems that have many potential solutions to explore).

- Pseudo-random numbers
	- Deterministic vs Stochastic Heuristic Search
		-  Deterministic heuristic search algorithms provide the same solution when run on the given problem instance regardless of how many times.       
		- Stochastic algorithms contain a random component and may return a different solution at each time they are run on the same instance 
		- Multiple trials/runs should be performed for the experiments/simulations 
		- Being able to repeat/replicate those multiple trials/runs in the experiments/simulations is crucial in science, and 
		- This also enables average performance comparison of different stochastic heuristic search algorithms applying statistical tests
	- Pseudo-random numbers
		- Definition
			- A long sequence of numbers that is produced using a deterministic process but which appear to be random.
			- Note that most computers and programming languages have support to produce pseudorandom numbers, and often with seeding
