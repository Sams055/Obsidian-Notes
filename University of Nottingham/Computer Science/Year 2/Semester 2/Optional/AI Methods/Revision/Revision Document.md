[[Lab 2 - Application of Iterated Local Search - 16.02.2023]]
- Local search has the mutation modifier, which means that it can explore.
- Accepting non-worsening moves also causes exploration, but having both of them can lead us to having too much exploration.

#### Lab 3

[[Lab 4 - Genetic and Memetic Algorithms - 02.03.2023]]
- Genetic Algorithms
	- Higher population size - More exploration
	- Higher Generation Count - More exploitation
